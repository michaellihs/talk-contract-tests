== Contracts should be about catching ...
* bugs in the consumer
* misunderstanding from the consumer about end-points or payload
* breaking changes by the provider on end-points or payload

Pact scenarios should not dig into the business logic of the Provider.

=== What can be improved
* Feature parity between implementations (v2, v3, v4)
* Documentation (pact-foundation consolidation)
* https://github.com/DiUS/pact-jvm[Pact-Jvm^]
** is implemented in Java/Scala/Kotlin/Groovy
** configuration via system properties
** documentation spread around in Readme.md files

[NOTE.speaker]

- Super responsive on all channels
- Consumer passing arguments for state changes works only on pact-jvm?
